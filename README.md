All the files on the git as supposed to be placed in a python project and you only have to run the "run.py". It has a port already specified in it. Make sure the Neo4j app and the port in run.py are same. 
To run the project , you first need to open the Neo4j app and create a normal database and start it. Later, run the run.py file which will show you two links to run the application on. Select the second link and the application is good to go. [You will need to enter the username and password of your neo4j app to make the connection.] You  can view the demo video to learn about the  functionality.
